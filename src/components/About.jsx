            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a paws-on pup with a penchant for simplifying fetch games 
                and automating daily treat dispensing. I stay vigilant in guarding 
                the house and following the best practices for playing fetch. 
                I'm a quick learner, constantly adapting to new tricks and always 
                eager to explore fresh scents.
